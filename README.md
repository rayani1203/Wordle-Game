Clone of a popular online web game, Wordle, where users have 6 guesses to guess a random 5 letter word. Feedback is provided after every guess based on how many letters are placed perfectly, correctly but not perfectly, or incorrectly. This game is an HTML webpage with CSS styling and animations with the logic done in Javascript. RapidAPI was used to get the random word and verify the user's guess.
